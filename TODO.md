# TODO

* Chunked uploads, and chunked request authentication.
* Delete multiple objects.
* Object tagging.
* ACLs.
* Figure out something better than konserve? With a lot of objects, the current usage of konserve could get unweildy.
  This is fine for mocking S3, but if you wanted this for something else, it would be a pain point.
